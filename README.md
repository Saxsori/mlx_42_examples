OK , Good question , I will show you how to develop game through Docker first You need to install Docker not matter what OS you are using and next you need install :
x11 for Linux and MacOS , and [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) for Windows.

when everything is done.

this project come with `.devcontainer` folder , that means you can use with vcode  run with conatiner and after docker run and you have access to your terminal on docker container.

set Display to <HOST IP>:0.0

```bash 

export DISPLAY=<HOST IP>:0.0

```

On your PC not docker make sure write this command to your terminal :

for MAC
```bash
xhost + .
```

For windows

search on app for Xlunch and run it.
